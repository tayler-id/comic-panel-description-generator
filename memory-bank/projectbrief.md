# Comic Panel Description Generator - Project Brief

## Project Overview
Comic Panel Description Generator is an AI-powered tool that automatically converts comic sketches into textual panel descriptions. This project aims to save comic artists hours of tedious scripting work by using computer vision and AI text generation to analyze sketches and produce descriptive text for each panel.

## Core Requirements
1. Image processing to analyze comic sketches (JPG/PNG)
2. AI text generation for panel descriptions
3. Simple web interface for uploading sketches and viewing results
4. Containerized application using Docker
5. Fast deployment to Render.com

## Project Goals
- Save comic artists significant time in the scripting process
- Create a reliable, fast tool that produces useful panel descriptions
- Embrace "creative chaos" - turn rough sketches into descriptive text that delights artists
- Deliver a functional product within a 5-hour development window
- Generate revenue through SaaS or one-time purchase model

## Target Audience
- Comic artists and creators who need to script their panels
- Independent comic creators with limited time and resources
- Comic studios looking to streamline their production process

## Success Criteria
- Successful detection of figures and elements in comic sketches
- Generation of useful, descriptive panel text
- Deployment to Render.com within the 5-hour window
- Positive feedback from comic artists on time savings
- Revenue generation through $20/month or $50 one-time purchases

## Constraints
- Must complete development within 5 hours (11:45 PM to 4:45 AM EST)
- Must use Python 3.9+, OpenCV, and Flask
- Must be containerized with Docker
- Must be deployable to Render.com free tier
- Must prioritize speed and functionality over perfection

## Timeline
- Docker Setup: 45 minutes
- Image Processing: 1 hour
- Text Generation: 1 hour
