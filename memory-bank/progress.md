## What's Left to Build

### Phase 5: Deployment (75% Complete, 30 minutes)

- [x] **Local Testing**
  - [x] Container build
  - [x] Functionality verification
  - [x] Performance check

- [x] **Render.com Setup**
  - [x] Service configuration in render.yaml
  - [x] Environment variables configuration
  - [ ] Account creation/login

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository
  - [ ] Service launch
  - [ ] Verification

## Current Status

The project is in the final development phase. We have successfully built and tested the Comic Panel Description Generator locally. The Docker container is running with all components working as expected. The application can analyze comic sketches and generate panel descriptions using the GPT-2 model (with Grok API as an optional alternative). The render.yaml file has been configured for deployment to Render.com, and the next step is to complete the deployment process.

## Known Issues

- **Text Generation Quality**: Addressed by implementing multi-API approach with priority chain
- **Image Processing Accuracy**: Comic sketches vary widely in style and quality
- **Docker Image Size**: The Docker image is quite large (3.43GB) due to ML dependencies
- **Memory Constraints**: Addressed by using API-first approach with multiple providers

## Blockers

Currently, there are no blockers preventing the deployment to Render.com.

## Next Actions

1. Deploy the application to Render.com
2. Set up environment variables on Render.com
3. Verify the deployed application
4. Begin marketing efforts on X and Discord
5. Monitor initial user feedback

## Success Metrics

- **Development Completion**: All components functional within 5-hour window
- **Deployment Success**: Live on Render.com by 5:00 AM EST
- **Initial Users**: First users testing the tool by 9:00 AM EST
- **Revenue Generation**: First paying customers by noon
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on time savings

## Marketing Plan

- **X (Twitter)**: "Comic nerds, AI scripts your panels, $20/month, DM me!"
- **Discord**: Target artist communities and groups
- **Direct Outreach**: Contact comic artists who have complained about scripting
- **Pricing**: $20/month subscription or $50 one-time purchase
