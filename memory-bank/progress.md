## Current Status

The project is in the pre-development documentation phase. We have pivoted to focus on the Comic Panel Description Generator, an AI-powered tool to automatically generate panel descriptions from comic sketches. The documentation has been updated to reflect this new direction, and we are preparing for the 5-hour development sprint.

## Known Issues

- **Time Constraint**: The 5-hour development window is extremely tight
- **Image Processing Accuracy**: Comic sketches vary widely in style and quality
- **Text Generation Quality**: Balancing descriptive quality with generation speed

## Blockers

Currently, there are no blockers preventing the start of development.

## Next Actions

1. Begin Docker environment setup at 11:45 PM EST
2. Implement OpenCV-based image processing
3. Set up text generation with Grok API/GPT-2
4. Create Flask web interface
5. Deploy to Render.com
6. Begin marketing efforts

## Success Metrics

- **Development Completion**: All components functional within 5-hour window
- **Deployment Success**: Live on Render.com by 5:00 AM EST
- **Initial Users**: First users testing the tool by 9:00 AM EST
- **Revenue Generation**: First paying customers by noon
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on time savings

## Marketing Plan

- **X (Twitter)**: "Comic nerds, AI scripts your panels, $20/month, DM me!"
- **Discord**: Target artist communities and groups
- **Direct Outreach**: Contact comic artists who have complained about scripting
- **Pricing**: $20/month subscription or $50 one-time purchase
