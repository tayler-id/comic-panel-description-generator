# Comic Panel Description Generator - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is in an urgent development phase with a strict 5-hour timeline (11:45 PM to 4:45 AM EST). We are building an AI-powered tool to automatically generate panel descriptions from comic sketches. Key focus areas include:

1. **Docker Environment**: Setting up a lean Python-based Docker container
2. **Image Processing**: Implementing OpenCV-based sketch analysis
3. **Text Generation**: Integrating Grok API or GPT-2 for description generation
4. **Web Interface**: Creating a simple Flask-based upload and results interface
5. **Deployment**: Preparing for rapid deployment to Render.com

## Recent Changes

| Date | Change | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-03-06 | Project Pivot | Shifted focus to Comic Panel Description Generator |
| 2025-03-06 | Market Research | Identified untapped niche with vocal demand on X |
| 2025-03-06 | Technology Selection | Chose Python, OpenCV, Flask, and Transformers stack |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (5-Hour Development Window)

1. **Docker Environment Setup (45 minutes)**
   - Create Dockerfile with Python 3.9-slim base
   - Configure dependencies (OpenCV, Flask, Transformers)
   - Set up Gunicorn for production serving
   - Implement environment variable configuration

2. **Image Processing (1 hour)**
   - Implement OpenCV-based panel analysis
   - Create edge detection using cv2.Canny
   - Develop contour analysis for figure detection
   - Implement motion and object detection heuristics

3. **Text Generation (1 hour)**
   - Set up dual approach (Grok API and GPT-2 fallback)
   - Implement prompt engineering for comic descriptions
   - Create consistent output formatting
   - Optimize for speed and quality balance

4. **Web Interface (1.5 hours)**
   - Create Flask application structure
   - Implement file upload functionality
   - Design simple results display
   - Add basic error handling and user feedback

5. **Deployment (45 minutes)**
   - Test container locally
   - Prepare for Render.com deployment
   - Document deployment process
   - Set up monitoring for initial launch

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Container vs. Microservices**
   - **Decision**: Single container for simplicity and speed
   - **Rationale**: 5-hour timeline requires focused approach
   - **Status**: Decided

2. **Image Processing Approach**
   - **Decision**: Use OpenCV with simplified heuristics
   - **Rationale**: Comics are line-heavy, precision is secondary to speed
   - **Status**: Decided

3. **Text Generation Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Dual approach with Grok API primary, GPT-2 fallback
   - **Rationale**: Flexibility for different deployment scenarios
   - **Status**: Decided

### Open Considerations

1. **Deployment Region**
   - **Options**: US vs. EU Render.com region
   - **Considerations**: Latency for target users
   - **Status**: Leaning toward US region

2. **Pricing Strategy**
   - **Options**: $20/month vs. $50 one-time vs. hybrid
   - **Considerations**: Recurring revenue vs. adoption rate
   - **Status**: Leaning toward offering both options

3. **Marketing Channels**
   - **Options**: X (Twitter) vs. Discord vs. direct outreach
   - **Considerations**: Reach, targeting, conversion rate
   - **Status**: Planning to use all three, prioritizing X

## Current Challenges

1. **Time Constraint**
   - 5-hour development window is extremely tight
   - Need to prioritize core functionality over polish
   - Focus on "good enough" results that save artists time

2. **Image Processing Accuracy**
   - Comic sketches vary widely in style and quality
   - Need to balance accuracy with processing speed
   - Accepting "rough detection" as sufficient for MVP

3. **Text Generation Quality**
   - Balancing descriptive quality with generation speed
   - Ensuring descriptions are useful for artists
   - Managing expectations for AI-generated content

4. **Deployment Speed**
   - Need to deploy quickly after development
   - Ensuring smooth deployment to Render.com
   - Preparing for immediate marketing after deployment

## Development Approach

- **Timeline**: Fixed 5-hour window (11:45 PM to 4:45 AM EST)
- **Testing**: Minimal testing focused on core functionality
- **Documentation**: Just enough for deployment and future reference
- **Code Quality**: Prioritizing working code over perfect code

## Environment Status

| Environment | Status | URL | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-----|-------|
| Development | In progress | localhost:8000 | Active development |
| Production | Planned | TBD (Render.com) | Deploy by 5:00 AM EST |
| Marketing | Planned | X, Discord | Begin at 9:00 AM EST |
