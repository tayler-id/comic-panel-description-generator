# Comic Panel Description Generator - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is in the optimization phase after initial deployment to Render.com. We have identified and fixed critical issues with the image analysis and text generation components. Key focus areas now include:

1. **Description Accuracy**: Improving the accuracy of panel descriptions to match actual comic content
2. **Image Analysis**: Refining the computer vision algorithms to better detect figures, motion, and objects
3. **Text Generation**: Enhancing prompts and parameters for more accurate descriptions
4. **User Feedback**: Collecting and analyzing user feedback on description quality
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring system performance and API usage

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Remaining Development Window)

1. **Deployment to Render.com (30 minutes)**
   - Create Render.com account/service
   - Connect GitHub repository to Render.com
   - Verify environment variables configuration
   - Deploy service
   - Verify deployment
   - Set up custom domain (if time permits)

2. **Post-Deployment Tasks**
   - Verify application functionality in production
   - Test with various comic sketch styles
   - Document deployment details
   - Prepare marketing materials

3. **Marketing Launch**
   - Craft X (Twitter) announcement
   - Identify Discord communities for outreach
   - Prepare direct outreach messages
   - Set up payment processing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Container vs. Microservices**
   - **Decision**: Single container for simplicity and speed
   - **Rationale**: 5-hour timeline requires focused approach
   - **Status**: Implemented

2. **Image Processing Approach**
   - **Decision**: Use OpenCV with simplified heuristics
   - **Rationale**: Comics are line-heavy, precision is secondary to speed
   - **Status**: Implemented

3. **Text Generation Strategy**
   - **Decision**: GPT-2 model for text generation
   - **Rationale**: Works offline without API dependencies
   - **Status**: Implemented

### Open Considerations

1. **Deployment Region**
   - **Options**: US vs. EU Render.com region
   - **Considerations**: Latency for target users
   - **Status**: Decided on US region

2. **Pricing Strategy**
   - **Options**: $20/month vs. $50 one-time vs. hybrid
   - **Considerations**: Recurring revenue vs. adoption rate
   - **Status**: Decided on offering both options

3. **Text Generation Quality**
   - **Options**: Further improve GPT-2 prompting vs. accept current optimized quality
   - **Considerations**: Time constraints vs. quality requirements
   - **Status**: Implemented improvements, monitoring results

## Current Challenges

1. **Text Generation Quality**
   - Implemented multi-API approach with priority chain (OpenAI → Anthropic → Grok → DeepSeek → HuggingFace)
   - Each API has optimized prompts for comic-style descriptions
   - Rule-based fallback as ultimate safety net
   - Need to monitor effectiveness of different APIs

2. **Docker Image Size**
   - Current image is 3.43GB due to ML dependencies
   - May impact deployment speed to Render.com
   - Consider optimization in future versions

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Implemented API-first approach with multiple providers
   - Local model only loaded if no API keys are available
   - API keys configured in render.yaml (without hardcoding values)
   - Need to verify functionality in production environment

4. **Marketing Execution**
   - Need to quickly transition from development to marketing
   - Craft compelling messaging for comic artist community
   - Set up payment processing for subscriptions/purchases

## Development Approach

- **Timeline**: Fixed 5-hour window (11:45 PM to 4:45 AM EST)
- **Testing**: Completed core functionality testing
- **Documentation**: Updated memory bank with current status
- **Code Quality**: Functional implementation with room for future optimization

## Environment Status

| Environment | Status | URL | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-----|-------|
| Development | Active | localhost:8000 | Running in Docker container |
| Production | Pending | TBD (Render.com) | Deploy by 12:45 AM EST |
| Marketing | Planned | X, Discord | Begin at 9:00 AM EST |
