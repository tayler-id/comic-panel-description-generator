"""
Example of how to modify the code and see the changes reflected without rebuilding the Docker container.

This script demonstrates how to make a simple modification to the vision.py file
to change how figures are detected in comic panels.

Usage:
    1. Run the Docker container with docker-compose up
    2. Run the test_hot_reload.py script to see the current behavior
    3. Apply the modification shown below
    4. Run the test_hot_reload.py script again to see the changes
"""

# Original code in app/vision.py (around line 60):
"""
# Improved figure detection with better filtering
# Significantly increased minimum area to avoid counting small details as figures
min_contour_area = 2000  # Increased from 300 to 2000
"""

# Modified code (change the min_contour_area value):
"""
# Improved figure detection with better filtering
# Significantly increased minimum area to avoid counting small details as figures
min_contour_area = 3000  # Increased from 2000 to 3000 for testing hot-reloading
"""

print("To test hot-reloading:")
print("1. Make sure the Docker container is running with 'docker-compose up'")
